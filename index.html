    <h1>Project on Console</h1>
    <p> Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.</p>
    <p>
        The Browser Console is like the Web Console, but applied to the whole browser rather than a single content tab. So it logs the same sorts of information as the Web Console - network requests, JavaScript, CSS, and security errors and warnings, and messages explicitly logged by JavaScript code.</p>
